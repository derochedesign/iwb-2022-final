Emergency will lay bare and exacerbate long-standing, systemic inequities related to poverty, racism, and other forms of discrimination. Special attention needs to be paid to the most vulnerable communities, to those who are most at risk from changes to the climate and wider environment. Long-term recovery depends on reducing the vulnerability of particular groups of the population to specific risks."

From the grief of losing and reclaiming a home, the Mattagami First Nation leverages Indigenous perspectives as a cultural anchor for those with similar experiences. This approach is twofold: both managing the immediate trauma related to environmental disaster and the long term effects of colonialism, while also creating the space to embrace culturally specific perspectives through a local, community-driven support system."

In practice, a pilot program like the Northern Rural Immigration Pilot Program offers migrants secure employment in underpopulated rural regions across Canada, integrating the agricultural skills of a migrant arriving from a climate-risk community. This framework would ensure legal and financial protections for a migrant to sustain the host community and protect themselves from the economic effects of climate change."
