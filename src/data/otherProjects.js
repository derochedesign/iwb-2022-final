      "The Upcyclecentrum is a project that connects entrepreneurs, residents, and a recycling platform in an experience center. The aim of the initiative is to make the circular economy and upcycling process visible to everyone and raise awareness in the community. The residents provide raw materials by properly separating their dry waste, the entrepreneurs (startups) upcycle these raw materials into new products and workshops promoting reuse and the repurposing of valuable materials are organized in a circular designed experience centre."
