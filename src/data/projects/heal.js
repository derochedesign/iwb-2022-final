      "Exposure to climate- and weather-related natural disasters have been associated with elevated levels of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. A significant proportion of frontliners develop chronic and severe mental health disorders caused by the trauma and losses, such as losing a home or job and being disconnected from the community. Without immediate psychological support, the mental health of an individual can deteriorate and cause escalating physical health impacts (often related to unhealthy coping mechanisms). In addition, the long term effects of integration into a new host society can make a climate migrant feel isolated from their community. Cultural barriers to integration are less addressed in the climate migration processes. Recently, a new survey of 10,000 people in 10 countries proved that an increasing number of individuals are becoming overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown, leading to a less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency: climate anxiety. Heightened stress can also contribute to secondary physical and psychological issues.",
      "The identified users include climate-displaced people with mental health issues and individuals suffering from climate anxiety and grief. The need for psychological services increases in the aftermath of a climate-related disaster. However, a person might have access to immediate physical health services, but rarely will have access to immediate trauma support. At the same time, service disruptions and low availability or accessibility of services leave psychological requirements unmet. Additionally, insufficient climate-aware support makes it difficult to validate eco-anxiety and grief, leaving people living in the terror of uncertainty."

      "CARE4U is a joint program of Red Cross Canada aimed at strengthening individual and community resilience of climate risk and anxious populations through a wide range of mental health services. When a disaster strikes, Red Cross Canada will notify CARE4U and allocate necessary resources, so that CARE4U can act as an immediate responder by offering effective psychological first aid. Early intervention in the aftermath of a natural disaster can prevent the onset or relapse of mental disorders in the long run. CARE4U therapists and volunteers are familiar with the multidimensional aspects of the climate crisis and its impacts on social and psychological well-being. They will listen and validate a person’s climate anxiety and grief arising out of the increasing instability of our planet. And nature therapy helps promote pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors by healing relationships with nature, further encouraging climate actions. In addition, CARE4U curates reliable resources and information from other professional organizations and equips people with knowledge and tools to properly prepare for and respond to recurrent natural disasters through workshops. Community members can create peer interactions and social connection and increase sense of community during group-facilitated activities. They will have the opportunity to receive professional training and become volunteers to make positive contributions to their community and other members.",

      "As a joint program of Red Cross Canada, CARE4U provides an effective mental healthcare system that can help climate risk and anxious populations recover from their traumatic experiences and deal with climate anxiety. The service is made up of highly mobile infrastructure (CARE4U Tent) and a digital platform (CARE4U App). Physical infrastructure will be implemented in risky zones where natural disasters frequently recur. Tents are made up of eco-friendly materials which can withstand a variety of weather conditions. CARE4U volunteers can regularly offer activities and workshops to help locals identify hazards and learn about how to prepare for each. Reliable resources and tools regarding disaster preparedness introduced and delivered in CARE4U tents can build trust and make the place iconic.",
      "When a disaster strikes, the local CARE4U team will respond immediately with the assistance of reinforcing resources allocated by Red Cross Canada. Victims can access psychological first aid and climate-informed therapy in CARE4U tents and referral to other services addressing basic needs provided by Red Cross Canada. The need assessment test results will help CARE4U volunteers better understand the most urgent requirements of users and offer relevant information and services. Individuals suffering from anxiety-related or traumatic responses will receive different kinds of mental health support including counselling, nature therapy, relaxation, mindfulness and meditation activities. Psychological services can be conducted in open spaces where users can benefit from nature’s healing power and peer support or in closed tents which offer safe and private spaces. Climate-aware therapists will conduct individual and/or group therapy sessions facilitated by volunteers. Community members can not only recover from traumatic experiences and strengthen individual resilience but also heal relationships with nature. They are able to join the CARE4U volunteer training program and help other members, which increases the sense of community and builds community resilience in the long run.",
	"CARE4U App offers professional mental health services for people who cannot or are uncomfortable visiting climate-aware therapists on-site. Users will receive customized plans and get timely notifications on the app after they sign up. Trackable user profiles can be easily utilized for long-term support. Online forum allows individuals to connect to climate migrants worldwide, sharing personal experiences anonymously and getting motivated by others’ stories in a confidential and inclusive space. Easily accessible resources and tools, such as local emergency services, educational tools for self-care and supportive resources regarding disaster preparedness, will be provided before, during, and after disasters."

      "Nearly 33,000 British Columbians displaced by wildfire in 2021. Lytton, known as “Canada’s hot spot”, is an extreme example of increased temperatures and recurrent wildfires. Last year, a wildfire destroyed 90% of the town. 1,200 people were evacuated from their land, with which they have deep connections. The aftermath of disasters has a significant impact on the socioeconomic and mental state of the survivors. Psychosocial interventions need to be emphasized apart from the government’s socioeconomic-focused interventions. Effective coping mechanisms and early interventions help to minimize the negative impact of disasters on mental health."

    bodyOut: [
      "CARE4U provides reinforcing psychological first aid by climate-aware professionals in a safe zone determined by the shelter in place protocol according to Red Cross Canada. Within 48 hours of the wildfire hitting Lytton, CARE4U tents will be assembled on site in the nearest designated communal shelter area. First, victims will be greeted by CARE4U volunteers guiding them towards the basic needs space, where community members will be able to access necessities such as food, Wi-Fi, and comfort items, as well as guidance to nearby resources and services provided by the Red Cross and our curated local database. Then, the member will be brought to the CARE4U private consultation tents, where climate-informed therapists will provide personalized psych evaluations as well as a treatment plan suitable to the individual’s experience. Finally, the aggregation tent will host a plethora of group based ecotherapy exercises to build mental resilience as a community. After the disaster, individuals will be able to check in with their personal treatment plan via the digital app, where they will also be able to access guided ecotherapy exercises, communication channels with climate-informed therapists and volunteers, and local workshops. The CARE4U tents in the post-disaster timeline will be utilized for these workshops to educate the general public on our climate mental health curriculum to reduce collective climate anxiety. Other climate-risk communities can replicate the success of CARE4U to promote the psychological resilience of climate anxious populations and boost climate awareness."
