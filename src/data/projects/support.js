      'The communities at the forefront of climate risk are often also those that lack the resources to prepare for or recover from a disaster. The adaptive capacity of these communities is vulnerable to climate risk. Because the infrastructure, industry, and environmental systems of these communities are centralized and precarious, they are more susceptible to long-term systemic failure or collapse in case of climate-induced disruption. Because resource allocation, local investment, or political influence is often slim, these communities adapt  to short-term "band-aid" approaches that are insufficient in addressing greater systemic failures. These minor adaptation strategies will generate greater risk towards the communities themselves. To adapt, many residents will decide to externally migrate for economic opportunity in a new country and send remittances (financial transfers) to support family members in the origin community. These remittances have contributed to over a $780 billion USD value to the global economy. Yet, this market is largely untouched and capitalized on to build resilience in emerging economies.',
      "The identified user is the external migrant who sends remittance back to support their family. Migrant remittance can improve household well-being, conditions, and productivity, particularly in times of natural or socioeconomic stresses or shocks. 80% of remittances are spent on urgent basic needs including foods, medicine, clothing, and shelter. There are indications that household use of remittances may include higher order needs like security or safety needs (environmental security and protection) after addressing fundamental needs with frequent and regular inflows. In developing countries, migrant remittances might be a significant source of funding for climate change adaptation and resilience building."

      "The Philippines has one of the largest percentages of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) funded by remittances, at 10% valued at $34.91 billion USD. In 2019, the largest proportion of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) was from Calabarzon at 20.7 percent out of the total OFWs. Calabarzon is located just outside of Metro Manila and is the second most populated region in the Philippines . It’s proximity to Metro Manila has sparked interest in the semi-processed industrial raw materials and components industries. Large factories have started to move their businesses in the area, sharing the vast land among small-to-medium sized farms. The region comprises five provinces: Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon, and one highly urbanized city, Lucena."

    article:"Considering the relationship and directional flows embedded into the climate migration process between the Philippines and Canada, could the market share of remittance users be leveraged to build community resilience in addition to individual resilience through local reinvestment and wealth redistribution?",
    bodyOut: [
      "As a prototypical application of Remate, the Philippines was identified as a key site of intervention. The Philippines, globally, has one of the highest proportions of its national GDP funded by remittances. Canada is one of the top contributors to Philippines’ remittance transactions, while also accepting 633,547 migrants from the Philippines per year. Remate found that by leveraging this intrinsic connection of cross-border flows between Canada and the Philippines, external migrants in Canada would be able to ensure that their climate-risk communities of origin would be able to build collective resilience against climate risk. Additionally, external Filipino migrants sending remittances would ensure individual resilience through increased social protections and capital. Senders in Canada would also benefit through the rewards system that offers competitive rewards points. For the case study, Air Canada was identified as a key corporate partner due to their proximity to climate change and carbon emissions, but also as a relevant stakeholder in migration and transportation flows. By partnering with Air Canada, Remate donations towards local resilience-building would hold corporations responsible for their social impact. It would also put more value into the user’s hands, by enabling them with credits and Aeroplan points towards necessary flights to and from the Philippines. Expansion is built into the UX of Remate, where other climate-vulnerable communities with high remittance rates beyond the Philippines, such as India and China, would be able to benefit from reinvestment of resources and funds in order to create collective resilience."
